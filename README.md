### Facebook Live Sellers Analysis & Sales Prediction  

This project combines two datasets to analyze social media engagement and predict sales based on advertising expenditures. The **Facebook Live Sellers dataset** explores engagement metrics such as reactions, comments, and shares to identify patterns using K-Means clustering. The **Sales Prediction dataset** examines the impact of TV, radio, and newspaper advertising on product sales using Linear Regression. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover correlations, and machine learning models were implemented to predict sales based on ad spend. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics like RMSE, and the Elbow method was applied to determine the optimal number of clusters in the Facebook dataset.
